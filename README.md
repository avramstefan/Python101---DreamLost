# Python101---DreamLost
Our game project for python101 class.


  @ We have decided to name our game "DreamLost", because it
is a "choices matter" game that consists in a man who
has to think twice before every move he takes. It is a 
game about chasing happiness, about recovering your soul through
discovering new things and aspects in life.
  There are two worlds that the user may want to travel to.
He can choose between a medieval era and a cyberpunk era.
  Every world has different types of endings, depending on
the choices that are made. 
  The key for finishing this game is to find a way for
recovering your soul through different types of endings.

## Endings ##

^^^ The best ending is when the button says "Finish your
adventure", when exit() function interferes and stop
the game.

^^^ The worst ending is when the final button is displaying
"You have another chance. Try again". That means that the
choices which the user has made were not the best.
The function era_choice() will interfere and return
to the "choosing era" slide.

  @ There are now rules to play this game. Simply start the
game and involve yourself into the story.

  @ The project has been implemented in python using tkinter and
some other modules.

  @ This is the link for downloading the game ->

  !!! There may be some warnings, but the main fact for them
  is because the size of the game is too large to be uploaded
  on github, so we created a google page were we linked our
  setup file.
