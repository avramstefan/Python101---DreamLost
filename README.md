# Python101---DreamLost
Our game project for python101 class.


  @ We have decided to name our game "DreamLost", because it
is a "choices matter" game that consists in a man who
has to think twice before every move he takes. It is a 
game about chasing happiness, about recovering your soul through
discovering new things and aspects in life.
  There are two worlds that the user may want to travel to.
He can choose between a medieval era and a cyberpunk era.

  @ The project has been implemented in python using tkinter and
some other modules.
